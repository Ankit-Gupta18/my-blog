Hi, my name is Ankit Gupta. I am a sophomore at IIIT Kalyani, pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about learning and discussing the latest techs, and have developed an inevitable interest in Web Technologies, Machine Learning, AI, and Competitive Programming. I am a curious person who enjoys figuring out the building blocks of the world and rearranging them to make them even better. 

I wish to travel the world with just one bag. When am not on my laptop, I am probably making pour-over coffee, reading fiction & non-fiction, and watching Harry Potter :p

  
I'd surely add more to the list as the days unravel!
