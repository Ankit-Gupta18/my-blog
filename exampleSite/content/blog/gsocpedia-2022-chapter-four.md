Ah! This week all started with excitement for the mid-term evaluations. I was pretty sure of getting good feedback from my mentors. Everything went well as expected and finally, I was landed to have the very first income of my life. My joy knew no bounds to have that credit message popping up on my phone screen!!

* Added caching for the JSON for fast response in verifying the source leading to a better user experience.
* Added the Edit Wizard button as a tab next to "edit" on the Wikipedia header tab.
* Added the functionality to verify the regexes present in the unreliable.json file. Now, the project can successfully verify the web URL as well as DOI.
* Code cleanup, fixed minor bugs, and added comments in the server files.
