This week was somewhat historic because I got a lot of feedback from the community members to work on and the mentors have raised several issues on the GitHub repository summarizing the feedback( nearly 15 issues I guess!!)

### Highlights

#### Week 9 - 10(9th August - 22nd August)

* Fixed a lot of bugs in the Wizard and further enhancements:
  * loading forever bug
  * extra button on the first screen
  * unusual font face in the tooltip
  * headers greyed between screens
  * backend request IP logging
* Displayed copyright boilerplate at the bottom of edit request publish screen.
* Included formatted reference in edit requests on the talk page.
* Upgraded user interface for selecting a location in the article, now users can click on the respective paragraph they want to edit rather than selecting the sentence.
* Added backed unit testing with chai and mocha and integrated them with the development pipeline to automate things.

That’s all folks. See you in two weeks!
